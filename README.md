# ODI Win Predictor

## Project Overview

The ODI Win Predictor is a web application developed using Streamlit that predicts the winning probability of an ongoing One Day International (ODI) cricket match. It takes into account various factors such as the batting and bowling teams, match location (city), current score, overs completed, wickets lost, and the match target. Using these inputs, it provides the percentage probabilities for the batting and bowling teams to win.

This project leverages a machine learning model trained with historical cricket match data to compute the winning probability. The user-friendly interface allows cricket fans and analysts to quickly assess the chances of a team winning based on live match conditions.
